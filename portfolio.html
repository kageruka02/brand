                <div class="aboutportfolio"> Hey, I'm IRUMVA Kageruka Leon Noel, a web developer who works on both the back-end and front-end of websites.My academic journey in software engineering has been marked by engaging coursework and hands-on projects. From developing a collaborative coding platform in my sophomore year to designing a user-friendly mobile app. I've gained valuable insights into various aspects of software engineering. 
<br> <br><br>

                    On the backend, I'm skilled in technologies such as Node.js and Express, where I handle the server-side functionalities that power websites. On the frontend, I work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with frameworks like React, to create user interfaces that are not only visually appealing but also user-friendly. Ensuring the code I write is clean and functions seamlessly is important to me. I believe that well-organized and efficient code contributes to better overall performance and user experience."
                    
                     I like making sure that the code I write is clean and works well. What makes me stand out is that I can handle both the technical stuff and make things look good for users. I stay updated on the latest tech trends to make sure I'm using the best tools for job.
